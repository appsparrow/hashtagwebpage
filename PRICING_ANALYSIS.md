## What You're Selling

A fully designed, live, mobile-responsive 1-page website for local service businesses (plumbers, cleaners, roofers, etc.) who currently have no website. The site is:

- Live at a real URL within minutes
- Ranked locally (Google can index it)
- Includes contact form, phone CTA, services, star rating
- Hosted on Cloudflare Pages (effectively free to you)
- Generated in seconds — your cost per site is near $0

Your competitive edge: **speed + zero friction for the customer**. They see it before they pay.

## Market Research: What Competitors Charge

| Type | Price |
|---|---|
| Fiverr 1-page site | $50–$200 one-time |
| Wix/Squarespace DIY | $16–$45/month (requires skill) |
| Local web agency | $500–$2,000 one-time + $50–$200/month hosting |
| GoDaddy Website Builder | $10–$25/month |
| Thrive Themes / WordPress agency | $1,500–$5,000+ |

**Key insight**: Most local businesses (plumber, barber, cleaner) will not pay $1,500+ upfront. But they WILL pay $50–$150/month if they see the site already working.

## Recommended Pricing Tiers

### Option A — Subscription (Recurring Revenue)

| Plan | Price | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| Starter | **$49/month** | 1-page site, hosted, contact form |
| Pro | **$79/month** | Above + Google Business integration help, 1 update/month |
| Premium | **$129/month** | Above + custom domain setup, quarterly refreshes |

**Setup fee**: $99 one-time (covers your time generating + onboarding)

**Why this works:**
- $49/month × 20 customers = $980 MRR passive
- $79/month × 20 customers = $1,580 MRR
- Your actual hosting cost per site: ~$0 (CF Pages free tier)
- Your marginal cost to add a customer: minutes of your time

**Best for:** Customers who want ongoing support, updates, domain management. Easy sell because the barrier to entry is low ("just $49 to keep it live").

### Option B — Buyout (One-Time, Higher Ticket)

| Package | Price | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| Basic Buyout | **$297** | Site files delivered, set up on their own hosting |
| Full Buyout | **$497** | Custom domain purchased + transferred, DNS setup, 30 days support |
| Premium Buyout | **$797** | Above + their own real photos added, Google Business setup, 90-day support |

**Why this works:**
- High-intent customers who don't want "another subscription"
- Especially good for businesses that already have Google reviews and want to look professional
- You spend ~30 minutes per client total

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid

**Step 1 — Free Preview (your hook)**
Show them their site for free. No credit card, no commitment. The site is live at your domain (hashtagwebpage.com/business-name).

**Step 2 — Convert to paid**

Present two options:

> **Option 1 — Keep It Live: $49/month**
> We host it, maintain it, and it stays live at your link. Cancel anytime.

> **Option 2 — Own It Forever: $297 one-time**
> We move it to your own domain (e.g., lanier-plumbing.com), hand you the files, and you own it.

Most small businesses will choose $49/month because:
- $297 feels like a lot upfront
- They like the idea of "someone handling it"
- Subscriptions feel lower risk ("I can cancel")

## Unit Economics

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|---|---|---|
| Leads found per search | 5–10 | 10–20 |
| Sites generated per day | 5 | 20 |
| Conversion rate (free → paid) | 5% | 15% |
| Avg. revenue per customer | $49/month | $79/month |
| Churn rate | 10%/month | 3%/month |
| Time to 20 paying customers | 3–4 months | 6–8 weeks |

At 20 customers × $49/month = **$980 MRR** — enough to cover a full month of part-time income.

---

## What to Avoid

- **Don't price below $39/month.** It signals low value and attracts price-sensitive customers who churn.
- **Don't offer unlimited revisions** in low tiers — it destroys your margin.
- **Don't skip the setup fee.** Even $49 setup creates commitment and reduces no-shows.
- **Don't wait for payment before showing the site.** The "see it before you pay" model is your biggest conversion lever.
