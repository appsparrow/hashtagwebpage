## Tips
- Recommended size: 1600x900px or larger (landscape)
- Use high-quality images (Unsplash, Pexels, or AI-generated)
- The hero overlays a semi-transparent gradient, so photos with any brightness work
- JPEG format preferred for smaller file size
- After adding images, commit and push — Cloudflare Pages will auto-deploy them
